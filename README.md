# üêü Twitter Carp Data

[@dm4uz3 posted](https://twitter.com/dm4uz3/status/1340108111399559169) a Twitter [Conversational Ad](https://business.twitter.com/en/help/campaign-setup/conversational-ad-formats.html) format Card that was simply a picture of a large carp, with the text `carp`. The Conversational Ad contains a tweet call to action button, that tweets a copy of the card. After being repeatedly shared, in a matter of hours, the card went [viral](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/carp-tweets).

So far only the original carp tweets here, i'll add scripts and user data later.

## Tweets

`data/carp_card_tweet_ids.zip` contains a text file with 1 tweet id per line, containing original carp tweets that have the conversational card attachment.

## Future work:

Carp Epidemiology: Modeling the spread of carp tweets over the network of users.
